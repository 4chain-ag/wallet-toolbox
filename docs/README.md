## Swagger

[BRC-100](https://brc.dev/100) defines a Unified, Vendor-Neutral, Unchanging, and Open BSV Blockchain Standard Wallet-to-Application Interface which is implemented in this library within the WalletClient class. The API is laid out here as a swagger openapi document to offer a fast-track to understanding the interface which is implemented across multiple substrates. The JSON api is generally considered a developer friendly introduction to the WalletClient, where an binary equivalent ABI may be preferred for production use cases.
